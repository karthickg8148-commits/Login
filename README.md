🔐 Login Authentication System

The Login Authentication System is a simple and secure web application that allows users to register, log in, and manage sessions within a browser.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates how authentication can be implemented entirely on the frontend using localStorage and SHA-256 password hashing.

📌 Features

🧑‍💻 User Registration and Login pages

🔑 Password hashing using Web Crypto (SHA-256)

💾 LocalStorage-based data management (no backend)

🔒 Secure session handling for logged-in users

🚪 Logout functionality

🧱 Form validation for email and password inputs

💻 Responsive and user-friendly interface



---

🧠 Overview

Users can create a new account by entering their name, email, and password.
Passwords are converted into a secure hash before being stored locally to prevent exposure.
Once registered, users can log in, and their session is maintained using localStorage.
The app also provides the ability to log out, clearing session data.

🧰 Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Security: Web Crypto API (SHA-256 hashing)

IDE: Visual Studio Code

⚙️ How It Works

1. Sign Up

The user enters their details: name, email, and password.

Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 before saving to localStorage.



2. Login

The system verifies the user’s credentials by comparing stored hashes.

On successful login, a session is created.



3. Session Management

Logged-in status is tracked in localStorage.

Only logged-in users can access secure pages.



4. Logout

The session is cleared, and the user is redirected to the login page.
